## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The `rules_v2` feature gate (default: false) and `rule_deeplinks` gate (default: true) suggest a rules system for customizing agent behavior. Need to investigate: 1) Rule format and storage 2) How rules affect agent behavior 3) Rule deeplinks functionality 4) Relationship to .cursorrules files. This is likely related to project-specific agent customization.
